# MacAuth
MacAuth is an OAuth bridge for devices that cannot provide a modern web browser for authorization, such as vintage Apple Macs.

MacAuth allows a vintage device to initiate an OAuth flow with a web application, but the login is done via a modern device such as a smartphone. 
This flow is very similar to [Facebook Login for Devices](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/for-devices/).

MacAuth is a .NET Core 2.0 MVC Web Application, written in C#.
